# KNIME-Workflow-Automation

## Objective and Approach
The objective of this project is to Automate workflows in KNIME without accessing the premium (paid) KNIME server. The approach taken to try and achieve this was by executing the workflow through the command line. This was done by running a batch file. Now, to automate this, the methods possible identified were by using scheduling. There was multiple possibilities to implement this: Windows Task Scheduler, Node-RED or building a low-code scheduler from scratch on Python. All 3 of the methods were implemented and tested out and are illustrated below.
